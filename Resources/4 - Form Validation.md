Form Validation

## Form Validation

Your next assignment is to create a user Registration form, validating it with JavaScript. 

Validation is whether the details the user has entered are valid, as prescribed by the company or the organization who owns the website, for example some sites ask the username to have more than 4 characters, or password should be minimum of 8 characters, or enter an email address which is valid.

We will be using many forms in our website (Login, Register, Order Product, Cancel Order).

So, you need to design a Registration/Sign Up form with the following specifications:
1. Email (required)- **should be a valid email id** (example: john@example.com)
2. Password (required)- **Minimum of 6 characters**
3. Submit Button - Clicking it should show Registration successful, **only if details are valid**.(Should not reload the page - hint: search for preventDefault())
4. Alert or show if there are any invalid details
5. **Bonus - make it responsive(mobile friendly)**

This assignment would require understanding of:
- HTML forms
- DOM manipulation
- JavaScript(functional programming)
- CSS (for designing)

To submit this assignment you need to write your code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), and submit the link by making a PR under your folder in [this repository](https://github.com/raniyer/HomeMade_E-Commerce).

(Hint - you can validate email using just input type as email)
