Designing and Prototyping

## Designing and Prototyping

We need to start with the designing phase of our website. 

Create a basic wireframe/prototype using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, moqups, etc.

Don't dive too deep in... just create some basic structure, which we can follow and build upon in the coming weeks.

Here are some links to some of the tools you could use:
